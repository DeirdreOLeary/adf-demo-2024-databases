# adf-demo-2024-databases

Purpose: This repo is part of the demo of an ETL process from a subset of the StackOverflow database on a traditional SQL Server to Azure SQL Database using Azure Data Factory. It contains the schemas for both the source and destination databases as well as unit tests for the database objects.

The ETL (via Azure Data Factory) repository is at https://github.com/DeirdreOLeary/adf-demo-2024-etl
